  Plugin for creating MDX from remote content
</h1>

## Description

This is a minimal transformation plugin that takes sourced nodes and builds MDX File nodes out of them, with configurable node locations for the mdx field to use, and where to source the frontmatter.

Multiple source node type are supported with individual configurations.

Developed to be used for building MDX-based static websites out of TerminusDB data products hosted at [DFRNT.com](https://dfrnt.com?utm_source=gatsby), accessed via GraphQL.

The frontmatter is expected to be part of the node, and not the MDX contents. PRs and issues are welcome to add additional capabilities to the plugin!

### Dependencies

For this plugin to work, the following dependencies are recommended:

* gatsby-source-filesystem
* gatsby-plugin-mdx
* use at least one .mdx file from the local filesystem (to populate the GraphQL types properly)

### Learning Resources

Review the [MDX documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/routing/mdx/) first, and make local MDX files work before starting to work with remote nodes.

In essence, this is how remote MDX processing works:

1. In the sourceNodes API or through a plugin that does this step automatically, Gatsby content nodes are created. They will contain data as objects in the Gatsby Node structure.
2. MDX nodes are usually created from files, using the `gatsby-source-filesystem` plugin. When creating nodes from remote content, MDX File nodes needs to be created programmatically.
3. This plugin picks up specific node types through the `onCreateNode` API and extracts a frontmatter object to be converted into yaml frontmatter, and also extracts an mdx string from selected node types.
4. Once an `mdx` string with yaml `frontmatter` have been concatenated together, it is written as a File node with the .mdx extension into the Gatsby cache
5. The `gatsby-plugin-mdx` plugin picks up the MDX File object as usual and transforms it into an Mdx node that can be rendered as any other MDX content. 

## How to install

### ðŸš€ Quick start, step 1: prerequisites

To get started with this plugin, you need to have a working MDX support. To support querying for frontmatter and body, at least one local MDX file must exist.

1. Configure MDX according to the [MDX documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/routing/mdx/)
   1. Get a first MDX file working, sourced from the filesystem, and example at `./src/pages/mypage.mdx`.
   2. Once you have a working MDX configuration and you can see your `mypage.mdx` rendered properly (converted to html), you can add support for programmatic creation of MDX File nodes below (such as sourced from a remote location)
2. Install this plugin and prerequisites
3. Configure the nodes to pick up and their fields
4. Restart gatsby and if necessary, make a `gatsby clean`

### 2. Install plugin and prerequisites

```shell
npm install gatsby-transform-remote-mdx @mdx-js/react
```

### 3. Configure the plugins in gatsby-config.js

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: "gatsby-source-filesystem",
      options: {
        name: "pages",
        path: "./src/pages/",
      },
      __key: "pages",
    },
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-transform-remote-mdx`,
      options: {
        mdxNodeTypes: {
          "MyNodeType": {
            // If a hierarchy of objects is to be traversed, use a dot (.) for each level
            mdxField: "statement.markdown",
            mdxFrontmatterField: "frontmatter",
          }
        },
      }
    },
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-mdx`,
      options: {
        gatsbyRemarkPlugins: [
          {
            // The regular gatsby-remark-images does not support remote images.
            // A different plugin may be required
            resolve: `gatsby-remark-images`,
            options: {
              maxWidth: 1200,
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

### 4. Start gatsby

```shell
gatsby develop
```

## Available options (if any)

The only options available in this initial version is which NodeTypes that should be picked up to create Mdx nodes from, and where to find the `mdx` string, and where to find the `frontmatter` object. For the configuration options below, this would be the data in the node:

```javascript
const myData = {
  frontmatter: {
    author: "John Doe",
    slug: `blog/blogpost`,
    title: `John Does first blogpost`
  },
  statement: { markdown: `# Hello world\n\nHello world text` }
};
```

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-transform-remote-mdx`,
      options: {
        mdxNodeTypes: {
          "MyNodeType": {
            // If a hierarchy of objects is to be traversed, use a dot (.) for each level
            mdxField: "statement.markdown",
            mdxFrontmatterField: "frontmatter",
          }
        },
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## When do I use this plugin?

When you are sourcing remote MDX data, you need to get it into the Gatsby cache first. This plugin helps you accomplish creating locally cached MDX data. It replaced the previous functionality offered through `createMDXNode` previously available in `gatsby-plugin-mdx/utils/create-mdx-node`, and other similar solutions before Gatsby 5.

This plugin does not, and should probably not, handle any other tasks such as bringing sharp images and similar functionality. Such things should be handled through plugins in the regular MDX ecosystem.

It could be that frontmatter should optionally be part of the MDX string itself, but is left as an option for the future (or a pull request).

## Example sourceNodes as a reference

Using this example, to be used in `gatsby-node.js`, an MDX File node is created from an arbitrary string. Once created in sourceNodes, it uses the example configuration above, and becomes rendered through the created paged section next.

### `gatsby-node.js` sourceNodes section

```javascript
exports.sourceNodes = ({ actions, createNodeId, createContentDigest }) => {
  const { createNode } = actions

  // Data can come from anywhere, but for now create it manually
  const frontmatter = {
    author: "John Doe",
    slug: `blog/blogpost`,
    title: `John Does first blogpost`
  }

  const mdx = `# Hello world\n\nHello world text`
  const myData = {
    frontmatter,
    statement: { markdown: mdx }
  };
  const nodeContent = JSON.stringify(myData)

  const nodeMeta = {
    id: createNodeId(`local-data-${12345}`),
    parent: null,
    children: [],
    internal: {
      type: `MyNodeType`,
      mediaType: `text/html`,
      content: nodeContent,
      contentDigest: createContentDigest(myData)
    }
  }

  const node = Object.assign({}, myData, nodeMeta)
  createNode(node)
}

```

### `gatsby-node.js` createPages section

In below createPages example we use `getNode()` to resolve the node. The reason is that there is some interoperability issue, where at least one local mdx node is required for the GraphQL types to be properly created. Using createPages like below is a workaround for that issue.

Therefore the suggestion to create at least one real local MDX file, any page really, so that the GraphQL configuration is updated for Mdx nodes. If so, a regular GraphQL query can be used.

```javascript
exports.createPages = async ({ graphql, actions, reporter, getNode }) => {
  const { createPage, createNode } = actions;
  const result= await graphql(`
    query {
      allMdx {
        nodes {
          id
          parent {
            id
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `);

  result.data.allMdx.nodes.forEach((node) => {
    // For some reason, the fields are not showing up in GraphQL...
    const mdxNode = getNode(node.id);
    createPage({
      path: `/${(mdxNode?.frontmatter).slug}`,
      // component: path.resolve(`./src/layouts/page.jsx?__contentFilePath=${mdxNode?.internal.contentFilePath}`),
      component: mdxNode?.internal.contentFilePath,
      ownerNodeId: `dfrnt-graphql`,
      // The context is passed as props to the component as well
      // as into the component's GraphQL query.
      context: {
        ...mdxNode,
      },
    });
  });
};
```

## How to develop locally

```shell
git clone https://github.com/dfrnt-com/gatsby-transform-remote-mdx
npm install
```

It is suggested to run `npm link` in the directory, and then run `npm link gatsby-transform-remote-mdx` in the `example-site` used for development.
